# Agile Life

I've been working in a software development projects for a while.
And it seems to me that agile is one of the greatest thing in all the
software development.
It really makes life easier if it's followed well and drived by common
sense. And under common sense I mean not to strictly follow the agile manifesto
and practices prescribed by it. But applying the with awareness when are they necessary.
So it seemed a great idea to me to apply some of them to my life.

## Where it all begins

I've started doing some planning not that much time ago. Something like 1 year I believe.
And it was fine. I've got some tools to make it easier, implemented some practices and so,
The start point was the utilization of taskwarrior to manage tasks, calendar to plan the day
or for scheduled events and bunch of spreadsheets to make long term planning.  
All of that seemed to be something like a project I'm able to deal with with agile.
Due to the fact that I've the terms, goals, and the definition of done.  
And lately due to the lack of order in tasks I've taken a look on a agile practices.
Issues I've been facing with were:

- _Lack of tasks scheduling._ Actually I've been just adding them to the backlog and revizing
  them on daily basic. It was something like rewriting all the tasks to make them easier
  for understanding and adding update to task if it was not done.
- _Lack of understanding where all is going on._ Actually I'd not any knowledge where am I
  heading to by all of them. It seems it's due to the fact that tasks were rewritten daily.
  And those changes didn't added any stability.
- _Lack of statistics._ It wasn't that big issue. But currently ability to use it makes me
  happier. And forces me to revize what was done during the sprint.

## Where is it now

Current state of things is following.  
I'm utilizing sprints. Sprint is the plain agile sprint lasting for a 2 weeks.
Mostly from Monday to Sunday of next week.  
But they has a small difference. The planning session in a middle of a sprint.
Currently this planning session is set to first Sunday of a sprint.
It's purpose is to make planning easier by introducing ability to correct the second part of 
sprint. In life you're not able to always predict what will happen and it makes it a bit easier
to do planning.  

### Rituals

As it's scrum and we're still human being there're some rituals to.
There're two of them plannings and retrospective.
Planning is rather obvious. You plainly plan tasks for the following sprint.
And retrospective is about the review the results of the sprint.
Main idea of it is to just check what was done, what tasks are dangling,
what should you focussed at in a next sprint.
