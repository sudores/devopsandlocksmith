# Intro

I've been job seeker for a quite while lately and due to that I've got
a few quite interesting thought regarding how does it work, and how to get
some. It's mostly relevant for the ukrainian local market, and possibly
other eastern Europe countries, but may be useful for some.
So I intend this article as a summary of my experience. Not too extensive,
but I believe valuable.

## CV

Everything starts here. It's onepager of your whole professional life,
and it should show, that it was active, you did a lot of cool things, and
therefore you're IDEAL for them.
And now it's became pretty tricky to show the hiring side that you really worth
even consideration, due to high level of hiring automation and bloody red market
for seekers.

Your CV will be reviewed by Application Tracking System (ATS) and HR if you're lucky
enough.
And both of them, will never ever understand it, HR can know terms, has basic
understanding of the subject, but lack the understanding, as it's not their job.
And also, due to high volume of applications lately on shrinking market CV is read in few
moments, just as you scroll tiktok or what do you scroll usually.

Also you need to take into account widespread _ignorance_ towards others job.
HR will just get the brief description from teamlead who is in a hustle, and it will not
be complete. And opening will be made from fragmented and _heterogenous_ info, from sources
contradicting each other.

And out of this there're several key points:

- Enlist all the skills relevant, even if they repeat each other.
  Redundancy is not bad, things you consider obvious should be still added, even if it's
  something as common and simple as git. Not even talking about more complicated things.
  It's obvious for you, not others.
- Show your achievements. Even the smallest one will be great to add. Add 2-3 to each
  workplace, make them quantified, as people like numbers, add the number which will not be
  considered too common. It does not matter in real world if it's 10% or 8.7%, but matter in CV.
  Only things which can be useful for your advantage worth rounding, e.g. RPS, concurent users, etc.
- Sort things in right order. Too much was said about it. I'll be brief, important like skills,
  summary, contact, experience - first. All other somewhere at the bottom or second page.
