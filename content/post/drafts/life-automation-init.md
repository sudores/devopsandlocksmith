# Life Automation Init

This blog post will start the series of such blog posts about life automation.
All them will be about life automation.
How and why should it be done in some way.  
In this blog posts I'll share some of my solutions, as well as some tricks
regarding how ready made could be used more efficiently.

## So why?

### Time efficiency

Lets do not talk about all this bullshit like personal efficiency.
It actually has became a cult. But this would be a topic for next posts.  

Personal efficiency is mostly not only useless but even bad for us.
Even though we're forced to take in account that all of us do not
want to do boring things,
like tracking expenses, keeping your' docs well organized, etc.
But mostly all of us understand the necessity of such habits.
Due to their' positive impact on our' life.  
So here life automation comes. It allows us to get things done with less time
and thinking potential spent. Aw well as increases quality and accessibility
of our' data and services.

So the time efficiency is the first point.

### Higher quality

Have you ever tried to keep track of all your expenses manually?
I assume that it was not the best time you've ever spent. Like it not only
takes a lot of time but also introduces large field for human mistakes.
And every time when you see balance of your' account in finance manager
does not equals balance in bank app you're forced to find a mistake
in all your transactions. And it takes a lot of time. Don't it?
Especially because we're lazy which is not actually bad.
We're just trying to get rid of this boring task faster.  
But life automation should make it easier for us. Program does not have any
willing to make things easier. So it'll just create every real transaction.

So the accuracy of automation is the second point.

## How?

So this article starts the series of related posts on the common topic of
life automation.
All of them will have corresponding category and tag `Life Automation`.

See you all in the following posts! (:
