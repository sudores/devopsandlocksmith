# Personal Finance Management. Init

Greetings colleagues. Finally I'm here to discuss rather boring still necessary
thing. It's named personal finance management. I've some experience with that and
here am I to share it with my dear readers.

## Why?

Reasonable question for a huge part of humanity while they don't have enough money
to manage. As they state at least.
But the main thing I can say. If you've more
then 5 places to spend money within - you'll never know where they are going without
proper accounting.
It's not the rule I've got this from plain personal experience.
While this kind of things is crucial for any further financial development.
And not only financial even professional as it takes some money for a start at least.
I hope that this boring part would persuade you to start thinking about the finances
you posses and how you spend this resource.

## Where should I start?

So if my persuasions had any effect and you're here to change something. The first
thing you should start with is to track all and any of your expenses with proper
description. The main purpose of it is to make your spending thoughtful.
The first step is done. You're the 80% by the goal to understand what's going
on with your' finances if any your transaction has category and meaningful
description.

## What's income of mine?

It could sound rather weird but in my case I'd no idea what is my real income
for a while. I'd the wage which I got once a month and some additional income
from some additional jobs like part-time and freelance. And it was rather tangible
amount from 10 to 15 percents each month. So I'd highly advice you to track income
too. As income tracking with expense tracking would allow you to come to next stage.

## What all those above for?

All the things discussed above is just to get some data for further analysis.
All those boring and time consuming things you've been doing for a while was only
for data gathering. They've some pedagogical effect still data is on a first
place.  
You should review your reports on monthly basis as the month will be the smallest
discreet time unit of planning.
For a first few times that would be great to check the transactions in categories
which you've the most expenses within. I'm more then sure that some useless
transactions could be found there (do you remember meaningful descriptions?).
It's highly advised to check category which stands for groceries as a lot of us
make them-self happier with some small tasties.

## Budgeting

The composition of income and expense tracking with a bit of planning based on
previous experience added for a better taste.
The main purpose of budgeting is to set the strict limits for each category of
expenses. And as result the limits for overall spending for a period.
So here it comes to the real things with a real impact on your life.  
The budget sets the limitations for the expenses and you can start paying wage
to yourself (this word will be used further to refer to the wage paid to your self
only).
And the amount of wage should match the budgeted amount.
Here you'll start feeling the difference which we've been coming to.
It's the fact that you'll be no more dependent on paycheck dates. As you'll
have the some buffer you'll get money from which will be just deposited by your
paychecks.
And this buffer is about two things. It's about something called "Fuck you money"
and about the breaking dependency on paycheck dates.
If everything was done correctly and obvious things like the fact that you should
not spend more then you earn was not ignored your net worth should increase by it's
own if your outcome is not greater then your income.
Bellow you can see small diagram displaying what was I talking about here.

## Buffer?

Here we steps into the topic I'm still getting into. Still it's possible that I'd
share something useful for you.  
The buffer - key concept I'm relying on my finances currently. It's the separate
bank account which contains 3 average wages in average with adjusted for the possible
difference in your financial schedule and income dates.
And the main idea of the buffer is to give you a bit more freedom in your financial
decisions.  
Previously "Fuck you money" concept was recalled. And the main idea of it is that
you can stop dealing with human beings you don't like if money is only thing
connecting you without thinking of money.  
While buffer is not the "Fuck you money" in it regular meaning as it contains
assets only for a 3 month of life at most. It gives you free breathe because
at least you've understanding that for at least 2 month you're free to do anything
you want.

## What's about savings?

It's simple to implement savings here. Personally I'm saving the most of the excess
money. Those one which are excess for the average wage which should be added to buffer.
In scope of this article it should be enough. Still saving is wide topic which will
be discussed further

## Some small pieces of advice

- Do not use those fancy applications for a phone. They looks fine while being useless
- Think out about categories you create to keep balance between details and ease of use
- It's preferred to use PC for most operations. While phone should stand just as
  companion. To track something which will be forgotten, like cash transactions
