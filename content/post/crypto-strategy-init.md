# Crypto strategy init

So I've some experience of crypto investment and I want to sum it up. Still even
it's simple note for myself. Maybe you will find in useful. At least I hope so.

## Intro

So I'm investing in crypto for a while something like half a year regularly.
And the main rule I'm guided with is "Best investor - dead investor".
No panic sells, no trading, no speculations. My main portfolio is buy only
currently I'm just adding thing into it and does not sell anything out of it.
Still I'm able to get some additional lets name it "Bonus" income.
The main sources of it are the next:

- Launchpools - just to get some free tokens. Also some not intended speculations
  give me some additional income which I mostly leave in the launchpool tokens
- Airdrops income - just additional tokens income from the airdrops project.
  Some part of them is left for better times like `$AEVO`
- Not intended speculations. Like I've purchased some `$BNB` lately to put it
  into `$AEVO` launchpool on Binance and it's up raised giving me some of kinda free
  `$BNB`

## Main strategy

The main thing I'm doing is DCA (aka Dollar Cost Avergaing). It means rather simple
thing. I'm plainly purchasing `$BTC` and `$ETH` for the fixed amount every Saturday
morning. This strategy is known for it's stability and ease. And it just works well
for me as I'm increasing my overall wealth as reports states.

Besides the DCA I'm also doing something know as "Buy the deep" which means that
I buy additional assets when correction (asset price decline). Mostly I use it
to purchase some altcoins like `$OP`, `$ARB` and so which are widely diversified
Mostly not more then 1% per coin. Sometimes with increase of share up to 2% - 3%
when I'm sure in potential of the asset.

All of the mentioned above is about the long term, something like 1 year at least.
While the main part of investments seems not to be sold for a very long time.
May be more then 10 years or something. So crypto still is not about quick money
you can get them but it would be high risk and with option to lose everything.

## Besides of that

Also besides of the main strategy I'm doing I've some additional partially
mentioned as "Bonus income". The main thing about it is airdrops and
