## About the blog topics

This blog is intended to be a recource with useful things which should make your
life easier in some way.
Like life automation, useful tools, management and such things.
But also it's a personal blog with possibility for probably funny posts to
appear.

### The topic for technical part

As it was said previously I'm going to get some life automation into my life
to make it easier. So the main posts topic for the following month obvious will
be life automation. It should not be all about tech but also about some tricks
to make the automation easier.

### The topic of money gaining part

Also I'm going to write some stuff about money gaining. It could be about
startup creature as well as about retrodrops hunting. So I do hope that it
could be interesting for you as well.

### The DIY topic

Unfortunately as for now due to lack of time I assume that there will be no
such posts. But they should appear in future.
