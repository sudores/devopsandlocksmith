# Life Automation Report 01-22-2024

Greeting colleagues. Here's brief report about what was automated and some
stuff which I've found out about automation and related things.
These reports I assume will appear when some results regarding the topic would be
present. Like new software I've found, new techniques I've used and so on.
So let's the show begin!

## Implemented

So the things I've implemented. Briefly - not much. Mainly it's planning,
budgeting and some kind of CRM. And currently most of it is in beta stage.

### Planning

Regarding planning. So what I've implemented could be divided into 3 points:
financial, day to day and long-term. So regarding the first it's mostly related
to finances and will be discussed in the [Financial](#financial) block.

#### Day to day

##### Calendar

So regarding day to day planning. There're a bunch of stuff I've discovered and
the first big thing is calendar.  
It's just silver bullet for planning.
It could sound a bit obvious but calendar just makes you stick to it and follow
schedule. I don't know how does it work but it's so.  
Still it gives you even more.
And this even more is planning for a bit longer term like a week.
Just like you knows when will you be free and when will you be able to do your
personal projects which is crucial for personal development.
Also as a bonus to this you'll get understanding of how should you order your
tasks to get the maximum efficiency out of your'.
Like some should be set to the morning as you do it better earlier
and some set to the evening because they don't involve any mind efforts.  
So it seems to one of the best things I've discovered lately

##### TODO list

Regarding todo lists, I've been using the plain paper notebook to keep track of
tasks for a day. But lately I've started experiencing lack of statistics and
planning for longer term. And that was the point to start investigating new solution
for todos. I'd some experience with google tasks, org mode, todo.txt and such.
But no one of them worked for me. And here I've found taskwarrior. It seems to
be really fine solution for task management. The main cause for that is rather wide
functionality like burndown charts, great and easy to use metadata which allows
you to keep track of things and ease of integration via taskd server allowing you
to sync stuff between devices. I'm still trying it out but it seems to be good
fit for my use case.
And the main thing I like it for is ability to customize it in any way you want
to. And it seems that I'll use this ability and the use case would be described
in further articles.

##### uHabits

Still not sure how's it named. But it's a small application which I use to
track how is it going with my daily habits and track progress.
Rather straight forward things what I like. Just add habit and check-in daily,
weekly or whatever time period you want.
Definitely can advice it. Simple and do what I want it to. Also it seems to
be easily integrated to any kind of third-parties with a bit of code.

#### Long-term

Talking about that... you know it's kind of painful to deal with it.
Currently I'm doing it via spreadsheets but I'm facing some limitations
and lack of knowledge about. So it seems that it would be a great topic for
new article to get deeper into the planning.
I was seeking for some kind of software but mostly it's oriented to business
and not all works for me fine. So still seeking.
But I'm already trying to decompose it. May be it will become some piece of
software who knows.

_upd: I've found some solution which worth giving it a try. It would be attached
to links_

### Financial

#### Budgeting

Moving to finances. I'm still using firefly-iii and ghostfolio mainly.
I'm happy with them as tools for expense and portfolio tracking.  
But currently I'm looking for some kind of budgeting app. The main cause for it
is that I've bunch of variable expenses. Like this month I want to purchase
new backpack, next go to conference and so. And the annoying part is the fact
that neither firefly-iii nor any other system I've taken a look at does not support
budgeting in a way I want it to.
So the main idea of budgeting is to get understanding of how much will come,
how much will be spent and what's it planned to be spent for.
And just build up the plan starting from month through quarter and up to the year
just by summing up all the stuff.
And it seems to me that I'll be forced to develop it my self ar stick to spreadsheets

### Human relations

Human relations is the area where opening has been done. And it's named Monica

#### Monica

Do you remember DDLC? Then you could find rather funny that Monica finally
would be acquainted to all of your connections. But in case with this revision
you would be happy with that.
So Monica is rather simple system which allows you keep track of connections,
meeting with those connections, communication with them and so forth. And it seems
to be the thing I've been seeking for. I've rather pure memory especially regarding
people and this kind of thing I hope would allow me to get rid of this annoying
questions when someone texts you. Brief check up of connections would be a really
great thing for that purpose. And also keep track of who are you acquainted with
could be useful in some cases.

## Further plans
