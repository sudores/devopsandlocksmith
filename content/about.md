## Blog

This is small blog created with [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and
[blackburn](https://github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn).
It's assumed that here you will be able to find some useful or at least funny
things about IT, metalwork, management, personal life automation and other things
I'm interested in.
I hope you will enjoy reading and find here something useful in some way.

Here is the list of topics which are already here or are assumed to be here:

- Personal life automation
- Manager workdays
- DevOps and related
- DIY and home engineering
- Money earning
- Anything else I would be interested in

## Me

So, hi I'm pretty surprised that someone reads this. Then here's some stuff
about me as a person.
I'm a DevOps engineer with interests like engineering (pretty obvious), DIY and
metalwork especially, management, crypto, business creature and bunch of other
stuff. Which I believe you're not interested at all.
This section could be updated further with new details about me if they will be
necessary.
