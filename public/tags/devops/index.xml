      <description>Implementing IaC, foreword Now, I&amp;rsquo;m working at company which has a very weak automation. It&amp;rsquo;s really hard for me to understand why. This company has 3 system administrators (sysadmin further) including me, and automation could save a lot of time, especially infrastructure as a code (iac further).
A bit of background Company i&amp;rsquo;m working for is a small product company focused on implementation of on-premise solutions with tight cisco integration. And now we have a lot of local stands for mostly every customer, with transfer to customers power in last stages of project.</description>
